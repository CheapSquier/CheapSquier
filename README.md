Hi, I’m @CheapSquier, aka Wade Bick
I’m interested in data analytics and electronics (maybe leaning a little more towards embedded programming of MCUs lately).
Currently playing with an STM32 eval board but would like to expand to other MCUs and IoT applications. Want to collaborate on something? Connect with me on LinkedIn,
